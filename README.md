# PostOnMedium: 
This is for the first project of Udacity Data Scientist Term 2.


## Note: 
Users should download the 2018 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey file from the [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey1).


## Library used:

- pandas

- numpy

- os

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- scipy.stats

- statistics

- operator



## Project motivation

This analysis was intended to see the payment differences between female and 
male developers and identify reasons<br />
for this difference if it indeed exists.<br />


### The questions answered in this analysis are:

- Part I: How many men and women have taken this survey?

- Part II: Are females paid less than males?

- Part III: Are educational level different between females and males?
- Part IV: Is there real payment difference between female and male developers? 



**Missing data handling**: For the dataframe, rows with missing values in "Gender" and "ConvertedSalary" were dropped
**Categorical data handling**: Because all analysis are descriptive, therefore there is no need to use machine <br />

learning models. 


### Files in the repository include:

- README.md 

- the iPython file with all codes, named "data_scientist_udacity_term2_project 1.ipynb"
- Summary of the results
Payment difference were observed between females and males, and it might be ascribed to <br />


the experience difference between genders as males tend to have much more coding 
experience than femals.
